In this project, I have used the methodologies that can be applied to the
requirements-analysis and design phases of building easy-to-use and easy-tolearn
user interfaces. Specifically, the project helped me to learn how to
conduct interviews, write scenarios, conduct hierarchical task analyses and, conduct GOMS (Goals, Operators,
Methods, and Selection rules) analyses.
